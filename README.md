# project-tunein

This is an easy command line interface to https://tunein.com .

Requirements: 
- Python 3+
- bs4 python3 package
- mpv + yt-download or other cli player

Use:
```
$ ./tune-in.py search string
#	Name
1	Result 1 - subtitle 1
2	Result 2 - subtitle 2

Enter number: 
$ 1
```

Currently, it's set to use mpv as default, but the script can easily be edited to use other progams.
